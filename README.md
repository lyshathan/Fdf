# FDF (Fil de Fer) Project 🎨

Welcome to the **FDF** project! This project is all about creating a simple 3D wireframe renderer using the **C programming language**. The goal is to render geometric shapes (like cubes, pyramids, etc.) by using just pixels and lines, while working with **mathematics**, **graphics**, and some basic **algorithms**. Get ready to unleash your creativity and coding skills!

## 🛠️ How to Get Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lyshathan/Fdf.git
cd fdf
make
./fdf your_file.fdf
```

## 💻 Project Overview

The project consists of the following major parts:

- **Input Parsing**: Reading and interpreting the `.fdf` file format (which contains the 3D coordinates of the vertices).
- **Projection**: Transforming 3D coordinates into 2D to display them on the screen.
- **Wireframe Rendering**: Drawing the 3D wireframe on a 2D window using basic line-drawing algorithms.
- **Interaction**: Allowing the user to move and zoom the object using keyboard and mouse controls.

## 📝 Requirements

- **C** Programming Language
- **MinilibX** library for graphics (you can install it following the instructions provided in the repository).
- Make sure you have the required dependencies and libraries installed.

---

## ⚡ Features

- Simple 3D wireframe rendering
- Zooming in and out
- Rotation of the wireframe
- User-friendly keyboard controls for interaction

---

## 🔧 Controls

- **Mouse zoom**: Zoom in and out
- **Arrow keys**: Move the view
- **Escape key board**: Rotate the wireframe
- **+ / -**: Changing Z elevation
- **ESC**: Quit the program
